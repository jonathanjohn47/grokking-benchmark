# Session Summary — Thesis Gantt Chart & Setup

## Identity & Context

- **Name:** Jonathan John
- **Programme:** M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence, IU Internationale Hochschule (2nd thesis attempt)
- **Thesis Title:** *A Unified Benchmark of Grokking Predictors in Neural Networks*
- **Subtitle:** A head-to-head empirical comparison of 9 published grokking predictors under a unified benchmark protocol
- **Supervisor:** Prof. Dr.-Ing. Sheikh Faisal Rashid (AI, Berlin campus)
- **Official Start Date:** June 22, 2026
- **Location:** Jammu, India

---

## Supervisor Instructions (from email thread)

- Use the existing **4-predictor baseline** as a starting point, then extend to **9 predictors**
- Prepare a complete **thesis timeline (Gantt chart)** with deliverables and milestones
- Two open questions from Prof. Rashid:
    1. What was the **previous thesis topic**? (2nd topic must be different)
    2. Have I **moved to Jammu**? (noted in signature)

---

## Project Plan (unchanged reference material)

- **Critical gate (M1):** reproduce Nanda et al. grokking on `(a+b) mod 97` before any predictor work begins
- **Predictor implementation order (easy → hard):** L2 Norm → Dropout → Spectral → AGE → HTSR Alpha → Correlation Traps → Weight-PCA → Higher-MI → Commutator Defect
- **Hardware target:** PyTorch + Apple Silicon MPS
- **Spreadsheet policy:** Always Google Sheets, never Excel/xlsx
- **Thesis Gantt chart:** Google Apps Script, hosted at
  `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Pst2P18QE3N7lbhnqwdkUN6OONTyTSPNCkSjTz7-RI`
  (rebuild: open sheet → Extensions → Apps Script → paste script → Run → `buildGantt`)

## Current Project State (Updated — July 6, 2026, later session)

- Scaffold created: `scaffold.py` (project root) generates the full `src/` folder structure —
  `src/__init__.py`, `src/data/__init__.py`, `src/data/modular_arithmetic.py`,
  `src/models/__init__.py`, `src/models/transformer.py`, `src/train.py`. All files existed empty
  before this session's work; `src/data/modular_arithmetic.py` now has real content (below).
- **`generate_pairs(number)` implemented** in `src/data/modular_arithmetic.py`, using nested loops
  and `yield` (generator). Verified correct for `number=97`: 9409 pairs total, each
  `(a, b, (a+b) % number)`.
- Added a `if __name__ == "__main__":` test block that does `pairs = list(generate_pairs(97))` and
  `print(pairs[5])` to manually verify indexing/output — this confirmed the generator produces
  correct values once materialized into a list.
- **Open design question raised but not yet decided:** should `generate_pairs` keep using `yield`
  (generator, not indexable — `ModularArithmeticDataset.__getitem__` would need to convert it via
  `list(...)` internally), or should `generate_pairs` itself build and `return` a list directly
  (Option A) instead of using `yield` (Option B keeps the generator, converts inside the Dataset
  class)? Jonathan understands the generator-vs-list indexing distinction (`pairs[5]` fails on a
  raw generator, works after `list(...)`) but has not yet picked A vs B. **Decide this before
  writing `ModularArithmeticDataset.__getitem__`.**

### What Still Needs to Be Done (Full Rebuild)

1. ~~`generate_pairs(number)` in `src/data/modular_arithmetic.py`~~ — done, pending the
   generator-vs-list decision above (may need a small revision depending on which option is chosen)
2. `ModularArithmeticDataset` class (`__init__`, `__len__`, `__getitem__`) — next up
3. `get_dataloaders(number)` — split + wrap in `DataLoader`
4. `src/models/transformer.py`: token + position embedding → attention → MLP → output head → `forward()`
5. Training loop in `src/train.py`
6. Run and confirm grokking curve (**M1 gate**)

## Jonathan's Learning Style Notes (carried forward)

- Learning Python while implementing — explain concepts before code; he writes the code himself, Claude only guides when stuck
- Prefers to understand the *purpose* of each function/concept before writing it
- Explains in Hindi/Hinglish when confused — respond in kind
- Very literal thinker — direct logical explanation works better than analogies
- Asks "why does this even exist?" / "agar ye naa karu to kya hoga?" — always answer the negative case directly
- Wants the big picture first when confused ("hamara motive kya hai?") — slow down, one concept at a time
- Does not move on until genuinely understood

## Pending (Not Yet Done)

- [ ] Reply to Prof. Rashid's two questions (previous thesis topic + Jammu clarification)
- [ ] Rebuild data pipeline (`generate_pairs`, `ModularArithmeticDataset`, `get_dataloaders`)
- [ ] Rebuild `src/models/transformer.py` (embedding → attention → MLP → output head → `forward()`)
- [ ] Write training loop in `src/train.py`
- [ ] Reproduce canonical Nanda et al. grokking (M1 gate)
